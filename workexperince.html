                <h2>Sandia National Laboratories</h2>
                <p>In May 2021, I joined Sandia Labs as a Technical Business Development Intern. Working in the labs has been one of the most rewarding and challenging experinces so far. </p>

                <h2>More at Sandia</h2>
<p>From the very start of my internship at Sandia, I was exposed to professional challenges. I was suprised at how much was delegated to me, and how quickly I had to adapt. This was very rewarding, and I apreciated how Sandia wanted to use my skills, but also teach me many new ones.</p>
<p>Most of my duties fall within proposal management. This means editing and creating many of the technical documents for PIs (the scientists at Sandia). These documents are tied to government, or sometimes private sector funding opportunities.</p>
<p>Since joining, my role has also expanded to data analytics and metrics. I quite often perform data pulls and create statistical reports to be used in presentations, or for lessons learned. Along with this, I am currently in the process of developing a python application for use in our department. Exceptional service in the national interest.</p>

                <p>From September 2020, to April 2021 I was an intern at Bernco in the Information Technology department. Many IT tools & concepts such as Active Directory, networking, SCCM and helpdesk support were delegated to me.  </p>

                <h2>More at Bernco</h2>
           <p>My first duties at Bernco was on the IT helpdesk. From there I had to quickly apply my foundational IT skills with a fast paced support hotline via email, IM, and calls. We were the primary frontline for all of Bernco's IT problems. I supported many departments such as fire and rescue, accounting and finance, and even the IT department itself!</p>
           <p>On the job I quickly picked up Active Directory skills, and was able to nagivate through this domain controller quite well. I soon started helping the IT department in-person weekly as well. I was called upon to help setup network switches, PC imaging and the Bernco domain, as well as many other duties. Every day was rewarding working at Bernco and serving the public interest. </p>

                <h2>Etsy</h2>
                <p>From June 2019, to July 2020 I ran an Etsy.com shop selling homemade goods. I had hundreds of orders with 100% customer feedback. This was an amazing entrepreneurial experince.</p>

                <h2>More at Etsy</h2>
<p>Etsy was not my first work experince, in fact it was not my first entrepreneurial pursuit. But it was a first for me in the world of online retail. I started on Etsy and Ebay selling handmade wooden items, such as coasters. This spurred from my side hobby in wood working. I also wanted to test some of my business skills I had learned at UNM such as accoutning, and finance, on a real world application</p>
<p>I soon had daily orders coming in, and keeping up with these orders along with school was sometimes difficult. But regardless, my business grew and so did my skills. I was soon preparing accounting documents and analytics for my Etsy shop. Eventually, my drive to learn computer science during my free time took me away from my online shop.</p>
