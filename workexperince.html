<div class="etsyd">
    <h2>Etsy</h2> <br>
Etsy was not my first job experince, but it was one of my more recent. I created a small business creating woodwork items. I did this from June 2019
to July 2020. I had hundreds of orders with 100% customer satisfaction. This became a way for me to test my analytical skills and accounting concepts.

<div class="bernd">
    <h2>Bernalillo County Government</h2><br>
    From September 2020, to April 2021 I interned at Bernalillo County Government. This was an amazing experince and I was shown, and given many responsibilites 
    in the county IT department. I learned active directory from the ground up, and many other entry level IT concepts.

<div class="sandiad">
    <h2>Sandia Labs</h2><br>
    Since May 2021, I have been an intern at Sandia National Laboratories. Specifically, a technical business development intern. This has by far been
    the most knowledge enhancing and rewarding experince yet. I work on many roles within proposal management. But recently, have been assigned handling various
    data and analytic pulls. This includes the creation of reports for senior management using said data.
